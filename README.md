# ToDo-List
This project took me the longest to do. It took me about 2 weeks and a few days but I learnt a lot doing this one. I learnt how to use the localStorage feature which was neat and I learnt so much working with arrays which was very rewarding in the end. I have a much better understanding of importing and exporting, using webpack, modules and object creators, array functions like forEach and filter which I had learnt before but never quite understood till now and just having a better understanding of working with objects in genreal.
You can find the code in the gh-pages branch if you would like to see, it is not the prettiest code in the world but I understand everything I wrote and it works.
